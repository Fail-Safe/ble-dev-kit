RSSI Probe
------

An iOS app that displays the RSSI values of three devices. Load a profile that advertises at a regular interval onto some HM-10s and then code their UUIDs into the source. Experiment with interesting arrangements and configurations. Includes a useful CSV logging capability so you can work with the data. Just plug your device into iTunes when your done and copy the log from the applications pane. Note that the app will not compile in the simulator; CoreBluetooth requires an actual device.
