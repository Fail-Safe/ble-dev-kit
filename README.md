BLE Dev Kit
====

Getting into low power Bluetooth peripheral prototyping can get expensive quickly. This is a project to chart out and the cheapest, easiest way to create a true, custom peripheral with it's own profile.

There are a couple of components of this project:

Hardware. A less-than ten dollar CC2541 development board based on the HM-10 module.
Firmware. On-board application and profile examples.
Software. Client application examples (iOS).
